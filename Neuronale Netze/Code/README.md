# README

How to get the dataset:
- Go to: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/

There you will find the two links (just copy them into the browser adress field and open them to download):
http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train_32x32.mat
http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test_32x32.mat

Download these and put them into the folder where this readme resides, keeping their names `train_32x32.mat` and `test_32x32.mat`.
