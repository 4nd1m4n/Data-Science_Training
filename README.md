# Data-Science Training

In this repository you will find the code and documentation of the projects i did at the end of each training module and
also the exercises i did to learn SQL and databases.

For each module an NVS (Nachvollziebare Schritte) paper had to be written wich contains explanations of what the written
code does and what results could be obtained from running it.
